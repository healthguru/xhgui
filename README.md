xhgui
=====

A graphical interface for XHProf data built on MongoDB.

This tool requires that [XHProf](http://pecl.php.net/package/xhprof) is installed, which is a PHP Extension that records and provides profiling data. XHGui (this tool) takes that information, saves it in MongoDB, and provides a convienent GUI for working with it.


System Requirements
===================

 * [XHProf](http://pecl.php.net/package/xhprof) to actually profile the data
 * [MongoDB PHP](http://pecl.php.net/package/mongo) MongoDB PHP extension
 * [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) MongoDB Itself


Installation
============

Installing Xhgui requires 2 main steps. First is installing the `xhgui` front-end, and the second is profiling a web application/site.


Installing the xhgui ui
-----------------------

* Clone or download `xhgui` from github.
* You'll need to install mongodb, and php-mongodb, at least version 1.3.0 is required.
* Point your webserver to folder `web/webroot` 
* Set the permissions on `web/cache` to allow the webserver to create files.
  If you're lazy `0766` will work. Run

  ```
  chmod -R 0766 web/cache
  ```

* If your mongodb setup requires a username + password, or isn't running on the default port + host.
  You'll need to update `web/config/config.php` so that it can connect to mongod. (see comments there fore more help)

* You may wish to add indexes (recommended but optional) to improve the performance, you'll need to do this by using  mongo console

  On your command prompt (irrespective of Windows or \*nix), open mongo shell using command 'mongo xhprof' and follow below  commands to add the index:
  
  ```
  $ mongo xhprof
  > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'meta.SERVER.REQUEST_TIME' : -1 } )
  > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'profile.main().wt' : -1 } )
  > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'profile.main().mu' : -1 } )
  > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'profile.main().cpu' : -1 } )
  > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'meta.url' : 1 } )
  ```

  That's it you added the indexes, you may notice now you are able navigate across pages faster

Profiling an application / site
-------------------------------

The simplest way to get an application profiled, is to use `external/header.php`.
This file is designed to be combined with PHP's [auto_prepend_file](http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.auto-prepend-file) directive. This can be enabled system-wide through `php.ini`. Alternatively, you can enable
`auto_prepend_file` per virtual host. With apache this would look like:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        php_admin_value auto_prepend_file "/Users/markstory/Sites/xhgui/external/header.php"
        DocumentRoot "/Users/markstory/Sites/xhgui/web/webroot/"
        ServerName site.localhost
    </VirtualHost>

With Nginx in fastcgi mode you could use:

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;
        root /Users/markstory/Sites/xhgui/web/webroot/;
        fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE "auto_prepend_file='/Users/markstory/Sites/xhgui/external/header.php'";
     }

Limiting Mongo Disk Usage 
-------------------------

Disk usage can grow quickly, especially when profiling applications with large code bases, or that utilize larger frameworks. One technique to keep the growth in check is to have Mongo automatically delete profiling documents once they reach a certain age. Decide on a maximum profile document age in seconds, you may wish to choose a lower value in development (where you profile everything), than production (where you profile only a selection of documents). The following command instructs Mongo to delete documents over 5 days (432000 seconds) old.

      $ mongo
      > use xhprof
      > db.results.ensureIndex( { "meta.request_ts" : 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds : 432000 } )
